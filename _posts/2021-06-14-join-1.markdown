## Introduction

<!-- important -> difficult and complex -> goal and overview of the article -->

As a critical component in SQL (Structured Query Language), the join operation is to combine two or more tables into a new table. 
On one hand, understanding the different types of joins and how they are handled at system level is central to mastering data processing.
On the other hand, joining tables can be a complex and confusing procedure for novice, due to the many kinds of join types and implementation options depending system conditions.

In this article, I will cover the join syntax, types, related concepts and pitfalls, go through the essential join implementation algorithms, and present the join order optimization problem and techniques, which are inevitable to a database system.
The goal is to provide a comprehensive guide that helps the audience understand SQL join in a systematic and intuitive way. 
I will use the below two example tables borrowed from Wikipedia[[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Join_(SQL))] through the text.

## Two Styles of Join Syntax
<!-- introduce sql syntax and standard join types-->

The starting point of the join operations in database systems is the join clauses in SQL, 
a domain language to query databases. 
SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, and the standard has evolved over the decades. 
Although various database systems have their SQL dialect, they all support five types of joins: ```INNER```, ```LEFT OUTER```, ```RIGHT OUTER```, ```FULL OUTER``` and ```CROSS```, specified in the ANSI standard.

In terms of the join statement, two specific ANSI standard syntax versions are important to include. 
The table below shows the difference.
The _ANSI 89_ syntax (old style / implicit join notation) uses a cross join or comma-delimited list of tables in FROM clause, and places the join conditions in the WHERE clause.
Note that no implicit join-notation for outer joins exists in standard SQL.
The ```OUTER JOIN``` example shown in the table is the syntax adopted in Sybase[[3]()].
While the _ANSI 92_ (new style/ explicit join notation) syntax uses a set of explicit key words like ```INNER JOIN```, ```LEFT JOIN```, et cetera to specify the join type, and puts the join conditions in an ON clause, where ON clause is used to specify the joining conditions over attributes.

A natural question to ask is: which style should you use? 
Although in practice many people find the implicit join is intuitive widely used, the explicit notation is known as the best practice [[2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11251751/which-join-syntax-is-better)]. 
The implicit way is not only harder to debug but also limitedly supported for OUTER JOINs.
It will also help eliminate the unintended cross product (inner join operations missing the join condition).

## Standard SQL Join Types

<!-- join operations definitions, results and applications-->

We are ready to understand the results produced by different join types.

**1. INNER JOIN**

```INNER JOIN``` is probably the most commonly used. 
It matches two tables based on column values.
The table below shows the result from the previous INNER JOIN query.
We should pay special attention to NULL values when joining, because NULL values will never match any other value (not even NULL itself).
For INNER JOIN, when the table contains NULL values, it is recommanded to enforce the integrity first,
or consider an OUTER JOIN.

**2. CROSS JOIN**

```CROSS JOIN``` returns the Cartesian product of rows from tables in the join as shown below. 
In other words, it will produce rows which combine each row from the first table with each row from the second table. 
It worth noting that the results of the ```INNER JOIN``` is a subset of ```CROSS JOIN```, with selection condition applied.
When the condition is always true (for example, ```SELECT * FROM employee INNER JOIN department ON 1=1;```), ```INNER JOIN``` and ```CROSS JOIN``` will produce the same results.
 
<img src="/images/join/join-4.jpg" class="left" width="100%" height="100%" />


**3. OUTER JOINs**

The major difference between an ```OUTER JOIN``` and a ```INNER JOIN``` is that the result of the ```OUTER JOIN``` retains each row, even if no other matching row exists.
An example use case would be to produce a report that shows ALL customers and their purchases[[2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1101343/what-is-the-purpose-or-use-case-for-an-outer-join-in-sql)].
That is, show even customers who have not purchased anything. 
If you do an ordinary join (```INNER JOIN```) of customers and purchases, the report would show only those customers with at least one purchase.


The result of a ```LEFT OUTER JOIN``` (or simply ```LEFT JOIN```) for tables A and B always contains all rows of the "left" table (employee table here), even if the join condition does not find any matching row in the "right" table (department table here).
The result of executing
{% highlight ruby %}
SELECT *
FROM employee
LEFT OUTER JOIN department ON employee.DepartmentID = department.DepartmentID;
{% endhighlight %}
is shown as the following.

<img src="/images/join/join-5.jpg" class="left" width="100%" height="100%" />


Similarly, the result of a **RIGHT OUTER JOIN** always contains all the all rows of the "right" table.
The result of executing
{% highlight ruby %}
SELECT *
FROM employee
RIGHT OUTER JOIN department ON employee.DepartmentID = department.DepartmentID;
{% endhighlight %}
is shown as the following.


<img src="/images/join/join-6.jpg" class="left" width="100%" height="100%" />


A **FULL OUTER JOIN** combines the effect of applying both left and right outer joins. 
It contains all the matched rows.
For the rows that can not be matched, NULL value will be filled for every column of the table that lacks a matching row.
The result of executing

{% highlight ruby %}
SELECT *
FROM employee
FULL OUTER JOIN department ON employee.DepartmentID = department.DepartmentID;
{% endhighlight %}

## Other Join Concepts

Except for the above standard join operations, there are many related terms that you will see in many scenarios.
That is part of the reason that makes joins confusing.

**```NATURAL JOIN```** is a join type included in _ANSI 92_ but not supported by some databases.
A NATURAL JOIN implements an equijoin, which returns rows combined from both tables when the values in the join condition match. While the join conditions can include one or more columns, you have no choice in selecting the join columns. A NATURAL JOIN checks the definition of both tables (in the data catalog or metadata) and looks for like named columns. It then joins the table based on the values of all like named columns from both tables.

A NATURAL JOIN can be an INNER join, a LEFT OUTER join, or a RIGHT OUTER join. The default is INNER join.

PostgreSQL, MySQL and Oracle support natural joins; Microsoft T-SQL and IBM DB2 do not. The columns used in the join are implicit so the join code does not show which columns are expected, and a change in column names may change the results. In the SQL:2011 standard, natural joins are part of the optional F401, "Extended joined table", package.

In many database environments the column names are controlled by an outside vendor, not the query developer. A natural join assumes stability and consistency in column names which can change during vendor mandated version upgrades.

NATURAL JOIN and USING Clause are mutually exclusive.
It should not have a qualifier(table name or Alias) in the referenced columns.
NATURAL JOIN uses all the columns with matching names and datatypes to join the tables. The USING Clause can be used to specify only those columns that should be used for an EQUIJOIN.


**The danger of NATURAL JOIN**

**USING Clause** is used to match only one column when more than one column matches.
The USING construct is more than mere syntactic sugar, however, since the result set differs from the result set of the version with the explicit predicate. Specifically, any columns mentioned in the USING list will appear only once, with an unqualified name, rather than once for each table in the join. In the case above, there will be a single DepartmentID column and no employee.DepartmentID or department.DepartmentID.



**EQUI-JOIN**, **NON-EQUI JOIN** and **Theta JOIN** are a group of concepts.




**SEMI JOIN**


**ANTI [SEMI] JOIN**
An Antijoin implements an outer join minus an equijoin, which returns a relative complement when the first query is a LEFT JOIN or RIGHT JOIN and a symmetric difference when the first query is a FULL JOIN.

**SELF JOIN**


**UNION JOIN**


In comparion to join operators, **DIVISION** is available in the definition of relational algebra.


**CROSS APPLY**

## Joins Order Optimization

when joining multiple tables, due to the fact that joining can only be performed on two tables at once, different join orders lead to different execution time. Therefore join reordering is a critical component in query optimization.
